# Sai Vara Prasad Bhaskarla — Streamlit Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with Streamlit.

## Quickstart

1. Create a new repo on GitHub and add these files (or upload the provided zip).
2. Edit `app.py` to update details and projects.
3. Put your resume at `assets/resume.pdf`.
4. Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud (share.streamlit.io) → **New app** → set main file to `app.py`.

## Notes
- Theme controlled via `.streamlit/config.toml`.
- Add more pages later by creating a `pages/` folder.
